Got as far to get my wanted initial inputs.
May want to add specifics like turns or trucks (takes up two * than one * for a car), and figure out how to do rates of how cars flow and a timer to judge them as well.
FIX THE THE FOR LOOP NEXT TIME, IM JUST TRYING TO GET A START FOR RIGHT NOW!

Still haven't figured out how to loop and print out a prper vertical road yet, will ask tomorrow.
Have to firgure out if I ethier want to use different vars. that will print different parts of mt road or find a way to make them rotate.
Also might want to find a way of how i can modify strings again with the printf method.
(code so far goes like this and i implemented the crosswalk for now)
